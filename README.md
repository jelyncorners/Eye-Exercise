# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes


Two beautiful animated eyes follow your mouse pointer everywhere on your screen as you hover on it. If your mouse pointer exits the screen, the eyes stops at the last position where your mouse pointer last location.

Instruction: • In the File menu, click Clone Repository. • Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone. • Choose the repository you want to clone from the list. • Click choose and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository. • Click Clone. • Start running the file index.html.

Roadmap of future improvement:
Interesting as it may sound but it reminds me of pineapple so I will design a pineapple with multiple eyes that follows mouse pointer also.
